## This is a markdown file

This is an R Markdown document. 
I'm not entirely respecting directives which asked for the file to be called HelloWorld.md - if I take the "R" away from this files filename extension, my R Studio (Version 1.3.1093, "Apricot Nasturtium" (aee44535, 2020-09-17) for Ubuntu Bionic), won't knit a PDF.
